# tcp-driver

The idea is the access TCP client connections like any other product driver code would e.g the cassandra or mondodb driver.<br/>

There are allot of situations where software in the past (my own experience) became unstable because the TCP connections
were not written or treated with the equivalent importance as server connections.

Writing the TCP connection as if it were a product driver sets a certain design mindset.

For design decisions see: https://github.com/gerritjvv/tcp-driver/blob/master/doc/intro.md
